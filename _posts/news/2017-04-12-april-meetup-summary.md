### Summary of April Meetup
Meetup date: 12th April, 2017

A small group of friendly coders, including front-end and back-end web developers attended our April meetup.

We discussed the following topics.
* Update and plan for our website
* Brainstorming and plan for our next project
* Planned visit by a web development company
* Personal projects

<br>
#### Update and plan for our website

![cool image](/img/200w_d.gif)

We have quickly created a very basic frame of the website using jekyll and github pages as you can see on this website! <br>
Now we can write a post like this quckly using markdown and simple html.

This website still needs some work in terms of styling/design refinement and contents.
Max and John agreed to take a look at the styling before the next meetup.  We are looking for members to contribute in any ways regarding styling, functionality, and blog posts.  Newbies, UX/UI people, coders of other languages are also welcome for inputs and code/idea contribution!

Tasks for the next meetup
* Max and John to take a look at the styling of the website
* Anybody available to help on anything to improve the website.

#### Brainstorming and plan for our next project
We discussed the next project - which technologies we would like to learn/use.
Considering that Angular 1 is still very popular and used by many companies, we decided to make a simple starter app using Angular 1.  Typescript was suggested to be used for this project.  Some of the members are familiar with angular 1 with vanilla javascript, but not with typescript.  So, we agreed to investigate on this.
Update (19 April, 2017): Currently, we are hacking existing boilerplate which is already available with angular1 and typescript.

Possible stack:
  + Front-end framework: Angular 1 with typescript
  + Back-end framework: API server with Express
  + CSS framework: Bootstrap 3
  + Hosting: EC2

#### Planned visit by a web development company
We would be grateful if we can network with the experienced front end web developers from the company.  We are looking for their talk and discussion with them.

#### Personal projects
Mark showed us his fun project using the ai image recognition technologies by [clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com).
